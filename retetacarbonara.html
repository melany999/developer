	<h1>Spaghetti Carbonara</h1>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
		<li>6 ounces pancetta, diced</li>
		<li>4 large eggs</li>
		<li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
		<li>1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, about 8-10 minutes. Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water.</li>
		<li>In a large skillet, cook the pancetta over medium heat until browned and crispy. Remove the pancetta with a slotted spoon and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
		<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, Parmesan cheese, Pecorino Romano cheese, salt, and black pepper.</li>
		<li>Return the drained spaghetti to the pot and immediately add the egg mixture, tossing quickly to coat the pasta evenly. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. If the pasta seems too dry, add some of the reserved pasta water, a tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached.</li>
		<li>Stir in the cooked pancetta and serve immediately, topped with additional grated Parmesan cheese and black pepper if desired.</li>
	</ol>
